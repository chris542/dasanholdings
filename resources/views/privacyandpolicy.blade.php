    <h2>Privacy and Policy</h2>
    <hr>
<p> Dasan Holdings believes the responsible use of personal information is critical to enable the Internet to reach its potential as a tool for personal and professional activities. In line with the Privacy Act 1993, Dasan Holdings is committed to respecting your privacy. You can visit www.dasan.co.nz without telling us who you are or revealing personal information.  </p>

<h3> Purpose of information collection </h3>

<p> You may choose to provide us with information such as your name, home or business address and e-mail address. For example you may choose to purchase a product directly from our Standards New Zealand website, subscribe to the 'Keep me up-to-date' service, or you can request specific information on products or services. When you give us personal information we will let you know how we will use it. We will also take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us, including using appropriate technology for credit card data used in electronic commerce transactions.  </p>

<h3> How information is used?  </h3>

<p> When Dasan Holdings receives information about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to improve our site and services. We will ask if you want us to use that information to continue contact with you â€“ for example, to send you new product information or notification of special offers. If you do not want us to contact you, you can choose to 'opt out'.  </p>

<p> In general on www.dasan.co.nz, IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyse this data for trends, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you. If we wish to do this we will give you the opportunity to 'opt out'.  </p>

<h3> Use of 'cookies' </h3>

<p> Some Dasan Holdings web pages use 'cookies', which are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. A cookie allows us to remember who you are. Cookies can make your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.) </p>
